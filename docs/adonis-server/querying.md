# Advanced Querying

Every Lumina endpoint supports filtering, sorting, search, pagination, field selection, and eager loading -- all via query parameters. The `LuminaQueryBuilder` translates URL parameters into Lucid ORM queries, providing an API surface identical to the Laravel server.

## Model Configuration

Define what is queryable on your model using the `HasLumina` mixin properties:

```ts
import { BaseModel, column, belongsTo, hasMany } from '@adonisjs/lucid/orm'
import { compose } from '@adonisjs/core/helpers'
import { HasLumina } from '@startsoft/lumina-adonis/mixins/has_lumina'

export default class Post extends compose(BaseModel, HasLumina) {
  // Fields that can be filtered
  static $allowedFilters = ['status', 'user_id', 'category_id']

  // Fields that can be sorted
  static $allowedSorts = ['created_at', 'title', 'updated_at', 'published_at']

  // Default sort when none specified (prefix with - for descending)
  static $defaultSort = '-created_at'

  // Fields that can be selected
  static $allowedFields = ['id', 'title', 'content', 'status', 'created_at']

  // Relationships that can be eager loaded
  static $allowedIncludes = ['user', 'comments', 'tags', 'category']

  // Fields searched with ?search= parameter
  static $allowedSearch = ['title', 'content', 'user.name']
}
```

:::warning
Fields **not** listed in these arrays are silently ignored. This is a security feature -- users cannot filter or sort by columns you have not explicitly allowed.
:::

## Filtering

Filter records by field values:

```bash
# Single filter
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=published

# Multiple filters (AND)
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=published&filter[user_id]=1

# Multiple values for one field (OR via comma-separated)
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=draft,published
```

Only fields listed in `$allowedFilters` can be filtered.

When a filter value contains commas, the query builder produces a `WHERE col IN (...)` clause. Otherwise it produces a simple `WHERE col = ?` clause.

### Examples

```bash
# Posts by a specific user
GET /api/posts?filter[user_id]=42

# Published posts in a category
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=published&filter[category_id]=5

# Posts that are either draft or published (excludes archived)
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=draft,published
```

## Sorting

Sort records by one or more fields:

```bash
# Ascending
GET /api/posts?sort=title

# Descending (prefix with -)
GET /api/posts?sort=-created_at

# Multiple sorts (first by status ascending, then by date descending)
GET /api/posts?sort=status,-created_at
```

Only fields listed in `$allowedSorts` can be sorted. If no sort is specified, `$defaultSort` is used.

### Default Sort

Every model can specify a default sort that applies when no `?sort` parameter is provided:

```ts
static $defaultSort = '-created_at'
```

The default sort supports the same comma-separated format as the query parameter. Use the `-` prefix for descending order.

## Search

Full-text search across configured fields:

```bash
GET /api/posts?search=adonis
```

Searches across all fields listed in `$allowedSearch`. The query builder produces an `OR ILIKE '%term%'` clause for each configured column, wrapped in a single `WHERE (...)` group.

### Relationship Search

You can search across relationships using dot notation:

```ts
// Model config
static $allowedSearch = ['title', 'content', 'user.name']
```

```bash
# This searches in post.title, post.content, AND user.name
GET /api/posts?search=john
```

Dot-notation columns (e.g., `user.name`) are resolved via `whereHas` on the relationship so that the `ILIKE` runs on the related table.

:::tip Combine search with filters
```bash
# Search for "adonis" only in published posts
GET /api/posts?search=adonis&filter[status]=published
```
:::

## Pagination

Control page size and navigate through results:

```bash
# Page 1 with 20 items per page
GET /api/posts?page=1&per_page=20

# Page 3
GET /api/posts?page=3&per_page=20
```

### Pagination Headers

Pagination metadata is returned in **response headers**, not the body:

```
X-Current-Page: 2
X-Last-Page: 10
X-Per-Page: 20
X-Total: 195
```

The response body contains only the data array:

```json
[
    { "id": 21, "title": "Post 21" },
    { "id": 22, "title": "Post 22" }
]
```

### Per-Page Clamping

The `per_page` value is clamped to the range [1, 100]. Requesting `per_page=0` is clamped to 1, and `per_page=500` is clamped to 100.

### Disabling Pagination

To return all results without pagination:

```ts
export default class Tag extends compose(BaseModel, HasLumina) {
  static $paginationEnabled = false
}
```

### Changing Default Page Size

```ts
export default class Post extends compose(BaseModel, HasLumina) {
  static $perPage = 25 // Default items per page (default is 15)
}
```

### Pagination Behavior Summary

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| No `?per_page`, `$paginationEnabled = false` | Returns all results (no pagination) |
| No `?per_page`, `$paginationEnabled = true` | Uses model's `$perPage` (default 15) |
| `?per_page=20` | Overrides model default, paginates at 20 |
| `?per_page=0` | Clamped to 1 |
| `?per_page=500` | Clamped to 100 |

## Field Selection

Select only specific fields to reduce payload size:

```bash
# Select specific fields
GET /api/posts?fields[posts]=id,title,status

# Select fields on included relationships too
GET /api/posts?fields[posts]=id,title&fields[users]=id,name&include=user
```

Only fields listed in `$allowedFields` can be selected.

The `id` column is always included automatically, even if not specified. This ensures relationships and pagination work correctly.

:::info
The table name or model slug is used as the key in the `fields` parameter. For a `posts` table, use `fields[posts]=...`.
:::

## Eager Loading (Includes)

Load related models in a single request:

```bash
# Load single relationship
GET /api/posts?include=user

# Load multiple relationships
GET /api/posts?include=user,comments,tags

# Load nested relationships
GET /api/posts?include=comments.user
```

Only relationships listed in `$allowedIncludes` can be loaded. Nested includes (e.g., `comments.user`) are supported via chained `preload` calls -- the top-level segment must be in the allowed list.

### Count and Exists

You can get relationship counts or existence checks by appending `Count` or `Exists` to an include name:

```bash
# Get the count of comments for each post
GET /api/posts?include=commentsCount

# Check if comments exist (boolean)
GET /api/posts?include=commentsExists
```

Response:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "My Post",
    "comments_count": 15,
    "comments_exists": true
}
```

These suffixes are authorized against the base relationship name (`comments`), so the user needs `comments.index` permission.

### Include Authorization

When loading includes, Lumina checks if the user has `viewAny` permission on the included resource. If not, a 403 is returned:

```bash
# If user doesn't have 'comments.index' permission:
GET /api/posts?include=comments
# 403 { "message": "You do not have permission to include comments." }
```

This prevents users from bypassing permissions through eager loading. Each included resource is independently authorized, including nested ones.

:::warning
This applies to all includes, including nested ones. A request like `?include=comments.author` checks permissions on both `comments` and the author resource.
:::

## Combined Example

```bash
GET /api/posts?filter[status]=published&sort=-created_at&include=user,comments&fields[posts]=id,title,excerpt&search=adonis&page=1&per_page=20
```

This single request:
- Filters to published posts only
- Sorts newest first
- Eager loads user and comments
- Returns only id, title, and excerpt fields
- Searches for "adonis" in searchable columns
- Returns page 1 with 20 items per page

### Response

**Headers:**
```
X-Current-Page: 1
X-Last-Page: 3
X-Per-Page: 20

```
